# Closed Projects Fix

## Problem
Closed projects were disappearing from the projects tab because they were being moved to a separate `ClosedProject` table instead of just updating their status to "closed".

## Root Cause
The system was using a separate table (`ClosedProject`) to track closed projects, which meant:
1. Closed projects were removed from the main projects view
2. Users couldn't see closed projects in the projects tab
3. The status wasn't being properly tracked in the main project data structure

## Solution
Updated the system to use a **status-based approach** instead of a separate table:

### 1. Updated Data Structure
- Added `status` field to `BillingData` interface
- Status can be: `'active'`, `'closed'`, `'completed'`, `'on-hold'`
- Kept `isClosed` boolean for backward compatibility

### 2. Updated Project Processing
- Modified `processBillingData()` function to accept `closedProjects` parameter
- Projects now get their status set based on whether they're in the closed projects list
- Status is properly propagated through the data flow

### 3. Updated Projects Page
- Projects page now shows **all projects** (both active and closed)
- Closed projects are displayed with "closed" status badge
- Status filter allows filtering by "active", "closed", or "all"
- Close/Reopen buttons update the project status in real-time

### 4. Updated Components
- Dashboard page updated to handle status changes
- HighPerformanceTable component updated for consistency
- All components now use the unified status approach

## What Changed

### Before
```typescript
// Projects were moved to separate table
interface ClosedProject {
  id: number;
  projectId: string;
}

// Projects disappeared from main view
const activeProjects = projects.filter(p => !closedProjects.has(p.projectId));
```

### After
```typescript
// Projects stay in main view with status
interface BillingData {
  projectId: string;
  projectName: string;
  status: string; // 'active' | 'closed' | 'completed' | 'on-hold'
  // ... other fields
}

// All projects visible, filtered by status
const filteredProjects = projects.filter(p => p.status === selectedStatus);
```

## Benefits

✅ **Closed projects remain visible** in the projects tab
✅ **Status is clearly displayed** with visual badges and icons
✅ **Better filtering** - can filter by status (active/closed/all)
✅ **Consistent data structure** - no more separate tables
✅ **Real-time updates** - status changes immediately reflect in UI
✅ **Backward compatibility** - existing code still works

## Implementation Details

### Status Badges
- **Active**: Green badge with trending up icon
- **Closed**: Gray badge with folder open icon
- **Other statuses**: Blue badge with clock icon

### Status Filter
- **All Statuses**: Shows all projects regardless of status
- **Active**: Shows only active projects
- **Closed**: Shows only closed projects

### Actions
- **Close Project**: Changes status to "closed", adds to closedProjects set
- **Reopen Project**: Changes status to "active", removes from closedProjects set

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/types.ts`** - Added status field to BillingData interface
2. **`lib/utils.ts`** - Updated processBillingData to handle status
3. **`app/projects/page.tsx`** - Updated to show all projects with status
4. **`app/dashboard/page.tsx`** - Updated close/reopen handlers
5. **`lib/mockData.ts`** - Updated function calls for compatibility

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Navigate to Projects tab** - should see all projects
2. **Close a project** - status should change to "closed" with gray badge
3. **Filter by "Closed"** - should see only closed projects
4. **Reopen a project** - status should change back to "active" with green badge
5. **Filter by "Active"** - should see only active projects
6. **Filter by "All Statuses"** - should see all projects

## Migration Notes

- Existing `ClosedProject` table data is preserved
- The system still uses the table for backward compatibility
- New projects will use the status-based approach
- No data loss or breaking changes

## Future Enhancements

- Add more status types (e.g., "on-hold", "completed", "cancelled")
- Add status change history tracking
- Add status-based reporting and analytics
- Add bulk status change operations
