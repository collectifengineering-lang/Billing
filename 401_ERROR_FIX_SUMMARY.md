# 401 Error Fix Summary

## Problem
Getting `401 (Unauthorized)` errors when accessing the app:
- `GET http://localhost:3000/api/projects 401 (Unauthorized)`
- `GET http://localhost:3000/api/setup-database 500 (Internal Server Error)`

## Root Cause
The API routes were using `optimizedZohoService` which requires database tables for token caching. If the database isn't properly initialized or if there are connection issues, this causes authentication failures.

## Solution Applied
Switched the following API routes from `optimizedZohoService` to `zohoService` (standard Zoho service without database dependencies):

1. **app/api/projects/route.ts**
   - Changed from `optimizedZohoService` to `zohoService`
   - Removes dependency on database for caching

2. **app/api/invoices/route.ts**
   - Changed from `optimizedZohoService` to `zohoService`
   - Removes dependency on database for caching

3. **app/api/dashboard/route.ts**
   - Changed from `optimizedZohoService` to `zohoService`
   - Updated financial metrics fetching to use standard service
   - Removes dependency on database for caching

## Additional Improvements

### Error Handling in Optimized Service
Enhanced `lib/zohoOptimized.ts` to handle database errors gracefully:
- Added try-catch around database queries for token caching
- Added try-catch around cache operations
- Falls back to fetching fresh data if cache is unavailable
- No longer throws errors when database is unavailable

### Invoice Field Fixes
Fixed invoice amount field references in `app/api/homepage-dashboard/route.ts`:
- Uses `inv.amount` or `inv.total` for compatibility
- Enhanced YTD date filtering with validation
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

## Testing

### Before
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/projects 401 (Unauthorized)
GET http://localhost:3000/api/setup-database 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error fetching dashboard data: Error: Failed to fetch projects data
```

### After
The application should now work without database dependencies. To test:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Check that projects load without 401 errors
3. Verify that financial data displays correctly

## Environment Variables Still Required

Make sure your `.env.local` file has:
```bash
ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
ZOHO_ORGANIZATION_ID=your_organization_id
```

## Performance Note

The standard `zohoService` doesn't use database caching, which means:
- Token is refreshed every time (within token expiry window)
- No persistent token cache across server restarts
- Slightly slower first request after restart

However, this is more reliable and doesn't require database setup.

## Future Improvements

To re-enable caching in the future:
1. Ensure database is properly set up with Prisma
2. Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema
3. Change routes back to use `optimizedZohoService`

The enhanced error handling in `optimizedZohoService` will make it more resilient to database issues.
