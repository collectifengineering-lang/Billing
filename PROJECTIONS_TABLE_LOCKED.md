**Backup File:** `components/HighPerformanceTable_BACKUP_20250929_152634.tsx`

## What's Locked In

The projections table (`HighPerformanceTable.tsx`) is now fully functional with the following features:

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Virtualized Table**: Handles large datasets efficiently with react-window
- **Real-time Editing**: Click any cell to edit values inline
- **Auto-save**: Changes are automatically saved to the database
- **Performance Optimized**: Smooth scrolling and rendering for large datasets

### ✅ Project Status Management
- **Close Projects**: Hide projects from table view while retaining financial data
- **Reopen Projects**: Toggle to show closed projects and reopen them
- **Visual Indicators**: Closed projects are clearly marked with badges and styling
- **Database Persistence**: Project status is stored in the database for all users

### ✅ Filtering & Display
- **Show/Hide Toggle**: Checkbox to toggle between active-only and all projects view
- **Project Search**: Filter projects by name
- **Status Counts**: Shows count of closed projects when they exist
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes

### ✅ Financial Calculations
- **All Projects Included**: Financial totals always include closed projects
- **Accurate Totals**: Footer shows correct sums for all projects
- **Monthly Projections**: Individual month totals include all projects

### ✅ User Experience
- **Clean Default View**: Shows only active projects by default
- **Easy Access**: Simple toggle to access closed projects when needed
- **Intuitive Controls**: Clear visual feedback and easy-to-use interface
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately across all components

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
- Uses `Project` table with `status` field
- Supports "active" and "closed" statuses
- API endpoints: `/api/project-status` and `/api/project-statuses`

### Component Architecture
- `HighPerformanceTable.tsx` - Main table component
- `ProjectModal.tsx` - Project management modal
- `CSVImportExport.tsx` - Data import/export functionality

### State Management
- Local state for UI interactions
- SWR for data fetching and caching
- Custom events for cross-component communication
