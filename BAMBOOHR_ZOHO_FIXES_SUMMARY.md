# BambooHR and Zoho Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented for BambooHR and Zoho integration issues.

## 🚀 What's Been Fixed

### BambooHR Integration (`lib/bamboohr.ts`)

#### ✅ **XML Parsing with xml2js**
- Added `xml2js` dependency for XML parsing
- Imported `parseString` function for XML handling
- Ready for XML-based API responses

#### ✅ **Compensation Import Enhancement**
- Updated `getEmployeeCompensation()` to use `/v1/employees/{id}/tables/compensation` endpoint
- Enhanced data mapping with fallback field names (both camelCase and kebab-case)
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

#### ✅ **Enhanced Logging & Monitoring**
- **Employee Import**: Logs success/error counts, individual employee mapping results
- **Salary Import**: Tracks compensation records, success rates, and error breakdowns
- **Comprehensive Import**: Parallel processing with detailed result logging

#### ✅ **Improved Error Handling**
- Individual error handling for each employee/compensation record
- Continues processing even if individual records fail
- Detailed error categorization and logging

### Zoho Integration (`lib/zoho.ts`)

#### ✅ **Token Refresh Improvements**
- **Retry Logic**: Increased from 3 to 5 maximum attempts
- **Backoff Strategy**: Base delay 5000ms with exponential increase (5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s)
- **Token Caching**: Enhanced caching of `access_token` and `expires_in`
- **Fallback Tokens**: Cached tokens for emergency use when refresh fails

#### ✅ **Enhanced Logging**
- **Token Caching**: Logs token details, expiry times, and caching status
- **Invoice Counts**: Detailed logging of invoice data, status breakdowns, and amounts
- **Rate Limit Headers**: Captures and logs all rate limit response headers

#### ✅ **Invoice Data Logging**
- Total invoice count and status breakdown
- Project-level invoice analysis
- Amount calculations (total, average)
- Sample invoice data for debugging

### Dashboard API (`/api/homepage-dashboard`)

#### ✅ **Raw Invoice Data Logging**
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Total counts, status breakdowns, project distribution
- **Amount Analysis**: Total and average invoice amounts
- **Sample Data**: First invoice details for debugging
- **Data Validation**: Checks for empty invoice arrays

## 🔧 Dependencies Added

```bash
npm install xml2js
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Build and Start
```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Zoho Invoices
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/invoices
```

**Expected Output:**
- Invoice count logging
- Status breakdown
- Sample invoice data
- API call count tracking

### 3. Test BambooHR Import
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/payroll/bamboohr" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"import-data"}'
```

**Expected Output:**
- Employee count logging
- Compensation record details
- Import success/error counts
- Pagination verification

### 4. Test Homepage Dashboard
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/homepage-dashboard
```

**Expected Output:**
- Raw invoice data analysis
- Status breakdowns
- Project distribution
- Amount calculations

## 📊 Log Messages to Monitor

### BambooHR Logs
```
🔄 Starting BambooHR data import...
👥 BambooHR employee count: X
✅ Employee mapped: Name (ID) - Department
💰 Salary record: employeeId=X effectiveDate=X annualSalary=X hourlyRate=X
📊 Employee import results: X successful, X errors
📊 Salary import results: X successful, X errors, X total compensation records
```

### Zoho Logs
```
🔐 Token cached: access_token=XXXXX..., expires_in=3600s, expiry=2025-01-XX...
📄 Fetching invoices from Zoho...
📊 Zoho invoices fetched: X total invoices
📋 Invoice status breakdown: {sent: X, paid: X, draft: X}
📄 Sample invoice data: {id: X, number: X, project: X, amount: X, status: X}
```

### Dashboard Logs
```
📊 Raw invoice data analysis:
  - Total invoices: X
  - Status breakdown: {sent: X, paid: X, draft: X}
  - Projects with invoices: X
  - Total amount: $X.XX
  - Average amount: $X.XX
```

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install xml2js
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Enhanced BambooHR and Zoho integration with XML parsing and improved logging"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Test on Vercel
curl -X GET "https://billing-collectif-engineering.vercel.app/api/invoices"
curl -X POST "https://billing-collectif-engineering.vercel.app/api/payroll/bamboohr" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"import-data"}'
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### BambooHR Issues
1. **XML Parsing Errors**: Check if `xml2js` is installed
2. **Compensation Endpoint**: Verify `/v1/employees/{id}/tables/compensation` is accessible
3. **API Key Permissions**: Ensure API key has access to compensation tables

### Zoho Issues
1. **Token Caching**: Check logs for token caching success
2. **Rate Limits**: Monitor exponential backoff behavior
3. **Invoice Data**: Verify invoice endpoint responses

### Common Error Messages
```
❌ Error mapping employee X: [error details]
⚠️ No compensation data found for employee X
🔐 Token cached: access_token=XXXXX..., expires_in=Xs, expiry=XXXX-XX-XX...
📊 Zoho invoices fetched: X total invoices
```

## 📈 Performance Improvements

### What to Expect
- **Better Error Recovery**: Individual record failures don't stop entire import
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Detailed logging for debugging and optimization
- **Improved Token Management**: Better caching and fallback mechanisms
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive invoice data analysis and logging

### Metrics to Track
- Employee import success rates
- Compensation record counts
- Token refresh success rates
- Invoice data completeness
- API call efficiency

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] xml2js dependency installed successfully
- [ ] BambooHR compensation import uses tables endpoint
- [ ] Employee and salary import includes detailed logging
- [ ] Zoho token refresh implements 5 retries with exponential backoff
- [ ] Token caching logs access_token and expires_in
- [ ] Invoice data includes comprehensive logging
- [ ] Dashboard logs raw invoice data counts
- [ ] All APIs build and run without errors

## 🆘 Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Node.js and npm availability
2. Verify xml2js installation
3. Review BambooHR API endpoint permissions
4. Check Zoho token refresh logs
5. Monitor invoice data logging
