# Troubleshooting 401 Unauthorized Errors

## Issue
Getting `401 (Unauthorized)` errors when trying to fetch data from Zoho API:
- `GET http://localhost:3000/api/projects 401 (Unauthorized)`
- `GET http://localhost:3000/api/setup-database 500 (Internal Server Error)`

## Root Cause
The 401 errors are caused by Zoho API authentication failures. This can happen due to:
1. Missing or invalid Zoho credentials in environment variables
2. Database not initialized for token caching
3. Zoho API rate limiting

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Verify Zoho Credentials

Check that your `.env.local` file has the required Zoho credentials:

```bash
ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
ZOHO_ORGANIZATION_ID=your_organization_id
ZOHO_ACCOUNTS_BASE=https://accounts.zoho.com
ZOHO_API_BASE=https://www.zohoapis.com
```

**To get these credentials:**
1. Go to [Zoho Developer Console](https://accounts.zoho.com/developerconsole)
2. Create a new server-based application
3. Add the scope `ZohoBooks.fullaccess.all`
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
5. Generate a refresh token using the OAuth playground

### Solution 2: Initialize Database (If Using Optimized Service)

If you're using the optimized Zoho service with token caching:

```bash
# Push the Prisma schema to the database
npx prisma db push

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

### Solution 3: Check Zoho API Status

Verify that the Zoho API is accessible and not rate-limited:

```bash
# Test Zoho connectivity
curl -X GET "https://www.zohoapis.com/books/v3/organizations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Solution 4: Use Non-Optimized Service (Temporary)

If the database setup is causing issues, the code now gracefully falls back without caching. However, you can also use the regular Zoho service:

**In `app/api/projects/route.ts`**, change:
```typescript
import { optimizedZohoService } from '@/lib/zohoOptimized';
```

To:
```typescript
import { zohoService } from '@/lib/zoho';
```

And update all references from `optimizedZohoService` to `zohoService`.

## Recent Fixes Applied

The following improvements have been made to handle database errors gracefully:

1. **Error Handling in Token Caching** (`lib/zohoOptimized.ts`):
   - Added try-catch around database queries
   - Falls back to refreshing tokens if cache is unavailable
   - Logs warnings instead of throwing errors

2. **Error Handling in Data Caching** (`lib/zohoOptimized.ts`):
   - Added try-catch around cache operations
   - Continues without caching if database is unavailable
   - Still fetches fresh data from Zoho API

3. **Invoice Field Handling** (`app/api/homepage-dashboard/route.ts`):
   - Fixed invoice amount field references
   - Enhanced YTD date filtering
   - Added comprehensive logging

## Testing

### Step 1: Check Environment Variables
```bash
# Verify environment variables are set
node -e "console.log(process.env.ZOHO_CLIENT_ID ? 'OK' : 'MISSING')"
```

### Step 2: Test Zoho API Directly
Create a test file `test-zoho.js`:
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function testZoho() {
  try {
    // Replace with your actual credentials
    const response = await axios.post('https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token', null, {
      params: {
        refresh_token: process.env.ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN,
        client_id: process.env.ZOHO_CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret: process.env.ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET,
        grant_type: 'refresh_token'
      }
    });
    
    console.log('‚úÖ Zoho API is working!');
    console.log('Token expires in:', response.data.expires_in, 'seconds');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Zoho API test failed:', error.message);
    if (error.response) {
      console.error('Response:', error.response.data);
    }
  }
}

testZoho();
```

Run it:
```bash
node test-zoho.js
```

### Step 3: Check Server Logs
Look for these messages in your server console:
- `üîÑ Refreshing Zoho token...` - Token refresh in progress
- `‚úÖ Token refreshed successfully` - Authentication successful
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Could not access token cache` - Database issue (non-fatal)
- `üìä Zoho API calls made` - API calls being made

### Step 4: Verify Frontend
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Check server console for detailed logs

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Missing required Zoho environment variables"
**Solution**: Set all required environment variables in `.env.local`

### Issue: "Zoho API authentication failed"
**Solution**: 
1. Check if your refresh token has expired
2. Regenerate the refresh token from Zoho Developer Console
3. Update the `.env.local` file

### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution**: 
1. Wait a few minutes before retrying
2. Implement request throttling
3. Use the caching feature to reduce API calls

### Issue: "Database connection error"
**Solution**: 
1. Verify DATABASE_URL in `.env.local`
2. Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema
3. Check Supabase connection settings

## Next Steps

After fixing the authentication issues:

1. **Monitor API Usage**: Check how many API calls are being made
2. **Implement Caching**: Use the database cache to reduce API calls
3. **Add Logging**: Monitor Zoho API responses for errors
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all API endpoints are working
